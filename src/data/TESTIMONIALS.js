        description: "I’ve worked with Angel to provide my health insurance for several years. I was referred to her by a business associate that raved about her. I was self employed and my wife had worked for Nordstrom over 27 years , when my wife retired we were left in a void and were amazed on what it cost for insurance as individuals, no plan. Angel was able to assist us in putting together a way to purchase insurance for half of what it cost on the Washington State website. In the following years whenever we had a question or a problem she was always there to help sort out what it took to make things work. Even though she worked at a larger company at the time we were always treated like her top customers. I was ecstatic for Angel when she opened her own Agency and have recommended her to family, friends and clients of mine because I know she will treat them “special” as she has always made us feel.",
